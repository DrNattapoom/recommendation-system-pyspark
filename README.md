# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the <b>ml-100k</b> dataset taken from <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/">GroupLens Research</a> at the University of Minnesota.

# Run
1. Create a <a href = "https://community.cloud.databricks.com/">Databricks</a> account and create a cluster
2. Upload the downloaded dataset and the `recommendation_system.ipynb` notebook to the Databricks cluster.
3. Open the notebook and run the cells to train the ALS model and make recommendations

<b> Note: </b> This project is a simplified implementation of <a href = "https://github.com/DrNattapoom/recommendation-system">recommendation-system</a> using Python and Databricks instead of Scala and Hadoop.
